# n_body_project
Code for n body orbits/choreographies with Max Ruffert


## To run code

n_body_v2.py currently contains the script that can be adjusted for ICs. The ICs can be changed at the top of the file, and the visualisation instructions changed towards the bottom. When this file is run, it uses functions from the other files in the repository to produce visualisations of the trajectories, based on the inital conditions, masses of bodies, etc., as well as plots to show certain quantities over time.
