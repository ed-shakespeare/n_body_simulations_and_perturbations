Maths issues so far:
•	Sometimes, each method gives very different trajectories – error in method or just the problem with unstable systems?
    •	For 2 bodies, since stable, it’s fine, but more bodies produces large discrepancies
•	Not going to keep G as an easily adjustable parameter – hardcoded as G = 1 in several functions, since it is unlikely to be changed.
•	Is my understanding of angular momentum correct? Based around CoM?
•	Eccentricity and energy sometimes oscillate – energy also decays sometimes. Often though, they are very large numbers, so problem somewhere 
•   How to do negative potential energy

Python specific issues so far:

•	Not able to add a legend for the animation

Notes for later

•	When testing ICs, don’t allow same initial position (and velocity) since these bodies will be degenerate
