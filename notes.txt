Computation takes 9.81 seconds before 'optimising'
A: Remove eccentricity: 7.79 seconds
B: Remove eccentricity, and CoM stuff: 6.20 seconds
C: Remove all conserved quantities: 3.92 seconds

Improvements:
    Adjust for loop for CFL dt to dupilicate repeated entries. With B method, gets to 5.6 seconds ish



Changes made: 
- Time step does every pair of bodies, and stores all, and selects minimum
    - Was a mistake before, just looking at the last body since it overwrote all others
